### Built With
This project is designed with technologies listed below - 
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
* [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co)
* [Slack](https://slack.com)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

First you need to install **NodeJS** and **npm** on your computer.
Then install **Zeit now cli** on your computer.
Then to get started with this project, you just need to clone or download this repository on your computer.


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/amit08255/slack-workbot.git
```

2. Setup and login to your zeit now cli.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Setting Up

1. We start by [creating a new Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps/new). After naming it, we customize it with our choice of color and icon. When creating a new app, Slack asks for an app name and a default workspace.

2. On the appâ€™s Basic Information page, we find that Slack allows us to add features to our app.

3. Create a new Slash Command called `/eval`. Each time someone types in `/eval your text`, Slack will send a POST request to a Request URL that we specify. We need to process the request and respond with the result we get from executing the code. 
For now set request URL to - https://serverless-eval.now.sh/

4. Enter a short description for slash command and click on - Save

5. Now go to slack app basic information page and copy client ID and client secret from app credentials.

6. Run below command in terminal (in your project directory) --

```sh
now secret add slack-client-id xxxx
now secret add slack-client-secret xxxx
```

7. Now to deploy to Zeit now, run below command --

```sh
now
```

8. You will be provided an unique URL for your deployed app. Copy that URL in request URL of your slack app slash command.

9. Now go to oath and permissions page of your slack app and click on - **Install app to workspace**

10. Now go to oath and permissions page of your slack app and add redirect URLs -- https://serverless-eval.now.sh/oauth.js  (replace https://serverless-eval.now.sh/ with your deployed app URL).

## Usage

* Invite app to any slack channel and run any of below commands for app --

1. `eval YOUR_TASK_DESCRIPTION` -- Add task with given description
